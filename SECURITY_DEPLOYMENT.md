# Security Deployment Guide

## Critical Security Gap Fix - Immediate Action Required

Your application currently has a **CRITICAL SECURITY GAP** where server-side security functions are implemented but the database schema is not deployed, causing security features to fail silently and fall back to bypassable client-side storage.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Deployment (CRITICAL - Do This First)

### Step 1: Execute Security Schema
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/functions/security-policies.sql`
4. Execute the SQL script

This creates:
- `security_events` table - Logs all security events
- `rate_limits` table - Tracks API rate limiting
- `failed_login_attempts` table - Tracks login failures
- `audit_logs` table - Comprehensive audit trail
- `transaction_limits` table - User transaction limits
- Database functions for security checks
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Functions
1. Ensure all 4 security edge functions are deployed:
   - `log-security-event`
   - `check-rate-limit` 
   - `check-account-lockout`
   - `record-failed-login`

2. Verify JWT configuration in `supabase/config.toml`

### Step 3: Test Security Integration
After deployment, test:
1. Failed login attempts (should lock account after 5 attempts)
2. Rate limiting on signup/login
3. Security dashboard should show real data
4. Check browser console for any security errors

## Current Security Status

### ✅ Working (Client-Side)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Password strength requirements
- Email format validation
- Session timeout monitoring
- Basic transaction validation

### ❌ NOT Working (Server-Side - Database Required)
- **Security event logging** - Falls back to localStorage
- **Rate limiting** - Falls back to localStorage
- **Account lockout** - Falls back to localStorage
- **Audit trail** - Not functioning
- **Security dashboard** - Shows "database setup required"

### ⚠️ Partially Working
- **Authentication flow** - Works but security events not logged
- **Transaction limits** - Basic validation only
- **RLS policies** - Applied to some tables, not all

## Security Risks Until Fixed

1. **Bypassable Security**: All security measures can be bypassed by clearing localStorage
2. **No Audit Trail**: Security events are not permanently logged
3. **No Rate Limiting**: API abuse is possible
4. **No Account Protection**: Brute force attacks are not prevented
5. **False Security**: Application appears secure but isn't

## After Deployment Verification

Run these tests to verify security is working:

```bash
# Test 1: Failed Login Protection
# Try logging in with wrong password 5+ times
# Should show: "Account temporarily locked"

# Test 2: Rate Limiting
# Try rapid signup attempts
# Should show: "Too many attempts, try again later"

# Test 3: Security Dashboard
# Go to Admin Panel > Security Dashboard
# Should show: Real security events, not setup message

# Test 4: Database Tables
# Check Supabase dashboard > Table Editor
# Should see: security_events, rate_limits, failed_login_attempts tables
```

## Emergency Rollback

If issues arise after deployment:
1. The security functions are designed to "fail open" - they won't break the app
2. Users can still login/signup even if security functions fail
3. Security events will fall back to localStorage temporarily
4. Check browser console for specific error messages

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Monitor Security Dashboard** - Review security events regularly
2. **Configure Alerts** - Set up notifications for critical security events  
3. **Update Rate Limits** - Adjust limits based on usage patterns
4. **Enable Advanced Features** - Add 2FA, advanced fraud detection
5. **Regular Security Audits** - Review logs and update policies

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Until the database schema is deployed, your application has significant security vulnerabilities. Deploy immediately.
